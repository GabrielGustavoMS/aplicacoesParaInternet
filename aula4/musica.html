        <h3>The Chainsmokers</h3><br>
        <p>Hey, I was doing just fine before I met you</p>
        <p>I drink too much and that's an issue but I'm okay</p>
        <p>Hey, you tell your friends it was nice to meet them</p>
        <p>But I hope I never see them again</p>
        <p>I know it breaks your heart</p>
        <p>Moved to the city in a broke down car</p>
        <p>And four years, no calls</p>
        <p>Now you're looking pretty in a hotel bar</p>
        <p>And I can't stop</p>
        <p>No, I can't stop</p>
        <p>So baby pull me closer in the backseat of your Rover</p>
        <p>That I know you can't afford</p>
        <p>Bite that tattoo on your shoulder</p>
        <p>Pull the sheets right off the corner</p>
        <p>Of the mattress that you stole</p>
        <p>From your roommate back in Boulder</p>
        <p>We ain't ever getting older</p>
        <p>We ain't ever getting older</p>
        <p>We ain't ever getting older</p>
        <p>You look as good as the day I met you</p>
        <p>I forget just why I left you, I was insane</p>
        <p>Stay and play that Blink-182 song</p>
        <p>That we beat to death in Tucson, okay</p>
        <p>I know it breaks your heart</p>
        <p>Moved to the city in a broke down car</p>

        <h2>Shape of You</h2><br>
        <h3>Ed Sheeran</h3><br>

        <p></p>The club isn't the best place to find a lover
        <p>So the bar is where I go</p>
        <p>Me and my friends at the table doing shots</p>
        <p>Drinking fast and then we talk slow</p>
        <p>Come over and start up a conversation with just me</p>
        <p>And trust me I'll give it a chance now</p>
        <p>Take my hand, stop, put Van the Man on the jukebox</p>
        <p>And then we start to dance, and now I'm singing like</p>
        <p>Girl, you know I want your love</p>
        <p>Your love was handmade for somebody like me</p>
        <p>Come on now, follow my lead</p>
        <p>I may be crazy, don't mind me</p>
        <p>Say, boy, let's not talk too much</p>
        <p>Grab on my waist and put that body on me</p>
        <p>I'm in love with the shape of you</p>
        <p>Although my heart is falling too</p>
        <p>I'm in love with your body</p>
        <p>And last night you were in my room
            <p>And now my bedsheets smell like you</p>
            <p>Every day discovering something brand new</p>
            <p>I'm in love with your body</p>
            <p>Oh—I—oh—I—oh—I—oh—I</p>
            <p>I'm in love with your body</p>
            <p>Oh—I—oh—I—oh—I—oh—I</p>
            <p>I'm in love with your body</p>

            <p>Every day discovering something brand new</p>
            <p>I'm in love with the shape of you</p>
            <p>One week in we let the story begin</p>
            <p>We're going out on our first date</p>
            <p>You and me are thrifty, so go all you can eat</p>
            <p>Fill up your bag and I fill up a plate</p>
            <p>We talk for hours and hours about the sweet and the sour</p>
            <p>And how your family is doing okay</p>
            <p>Leave and get in a taxi, then kiss in the backseat</p>
            <p>Tell the driver make the radio play, and I'm singing like</p>
            <p>Girl, you know I want your love</p>
            <p>Your love was handmade for somebody like me</p>
            <p>Come on now, follow my lead</p>
            <p>I may be crazy, don't mind me</p>
            <p>Say, boy, let's not talk too much</p>

            <p>Come, come on now, follow my lead</p>
            <p>I'm in love with the shape of you</p>
            <p>We push and pull like a magnet do</p>
            <p>Although my heart is falling too</p>
